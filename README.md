# 🛍️ React E-commerce Web App

This is a simple and responsive **E-commerce web application** built using **React.js**. 
It allows users to browse products, view product details, and manage a shopping cart — all within a clean, single-page interface.

## ✨ Features

- 🛒 Display product list dynamically
- ➕ Add products to cart
- 🧮 Cart item count and total calculation
- 💾 All data managed on the frontend (no backend)

## 📄 Extended Description

This project is built using **React functional components** and utilizes `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and lifecycle events. Products are displayed using the `map()` method, and all cart actions are handled with state updates. The app is fully client-side and ideal for practicing dynamic rendering, cart logic, and component-based architecture in React.

While it currently uses static or mock data, it can be extended easily by connecting with a real product API and adding features like search, filter, login, or checkout.
